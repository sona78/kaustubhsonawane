## Edinburgh
#### 4/1/25

It has been quite a while since this trip, but it deserves a post to remember it. This semester has been full of really cool new experiences. I have loved the process of learning a new place from the ground up, making connections with new people starting from no shared experiences, and seeing my assumptions about the world tested so often. But even with this joie de vivre, I miss the comfort of home. I moved houses in this past year, and for a time I had this strange experience of relearning what home was. Little things like trying to figure out the light switches, having to unpack and reorganize, and even work around the house not being able to find anything in the kitchen was quite jarring. Especially as I approach the end of college, between Austin and Dallas, each place I live feels temporary. But the people in my life are anything but that. Having this trip with some of my best friends reminded me that home is with the people I love as cliche as it sounds. I admit that I haven't been the best at maintaining relationships, but treating people as the only constant is a mindset I'm trying to grow into.

Edinburgh as a city was quite beautiful. While it had very clear industrial beginnings in its architecture, it had a sort of stability that I appreciated. Also after weeks of struggling with having grocery store interactions in Czech, German, and Hungarian, it was a funny intermission where I could speak to people. The best part of Edinburgh was definitely the nature. The city was a coastal city on the North Sea close to the most beautiful hills and greenest grass that I had ever seen. Some highlights of the trip: After walking around the city and doing a Harry Potter tour to see the sights with Aarushi, Neha & her friend Kekoa joined us in the afternoon after a morning of efficiently catching up on work. We got so lucky this weekend with the weather and decided to hike up to the top of Albert's seat, a giant hill in the middle of the city. Seeing the most beautiful views and an open field overlooking the city was perfect, and I had the best time just enjoying the views and the company.

We spent the next day together exploring the city's best spots. A special moment was on the Leith Waterway, where after a quick stop at the iconic Dean's Village viewpoint, we walked along the side of an unsuspecting creek and just enjoyed the peace. I thought about how lucky I was to have friends that I would grow with. Traveling together internationally felt like the start to the "adult" experiences we would have throughout our 20s. Visiting each other's cities in our time off, meeting each other's friends, and cheering at each other's weddings. Our friendships would evolve and change, but for just a little while I could enjoy being so close to those same people, living as cheaply as we could and enjoying the world without expectations.

Our last day was my favorite though. We took a day trip up to St. Abbs, a coastal town 2 hours out from Edinburgh on the train. After a brief morning crashout over train ticket prices that thankfully got resolved, we rode into the small city, grabbed a bite to eat with super good salmon, then made our way into the town. The highlight of the city was the nature preserve that was one of the prettiest places I had ever seen. We hiked over the greenest hills looking at the cliffs on the coast, saw sheeps grazing as we passed right next to them, and enjoyed the views and the peace of the moment. For a moment, I was home.
