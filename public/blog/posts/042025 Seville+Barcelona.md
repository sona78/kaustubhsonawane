## Seville + Barcelona

#### 4/20/25

When starting the semester abroad, we were told that we would have a 2 week long spring break. And while that initially felt like uninterrupted time to explore, coming into the semester it felt like a bit of a premature forecast. By April I will have a group of close friends with who I can travel and have insightful conversations and party and enjoy the silence. But so on brand, the thought created expectation, and the expectation combined with impatience created resentment of the current circumstances far before anything had ever happened. What I needed from the semester wasn’t another home base, it was to be okay with the discomfort and have the chance to build up groups from scratch. What in retrospect I appreciate the most is something I was trying to get away from, again, quite on brand. And while I chose to delay booking until a lot closer to the weeks than I probably should have, I’m happy that I had the flexibility to make that decision a bit later, choosing the places and people that made the stretch incredible.

Our first stop was in Seville in Spain, with most of the UT group members that I’d traveled with earlier on. One of my favorite “Wow” moments was meeting up with the group coming in from the airport at the Parque de Maria Luisa. There was some gate on a building to get to the park which I thought was odd, but opening up to the plaza I was just in shock. The area was THE Plaza de Espana, and in the sunset looked like it was glowing. The weather in Seville was perfect and the entire city smelled of jasmine and the incense candles burning for the Semana Santa (the week of easter). What we didn’t know is how large the celebrations were, every night past 5 PM, rows and rows of sevillanos wearing hoods that looked like the KKK in many different colors walked through the streets holding candles while large brass bands and floats filled with religious statues led the processions. What that meant for us was while it was an incredibly scene, getting around was impossible, one time missing a bus 1.5 hours ahead but only a 30 minute walk away.

Seville had a combination of incredible tapas style food, live music & flamenco performances, gorgeous cathedrals & architecture, and great art museums. Over the 2.5 days, we went to the Real Alcazar, an moorish & catholic influenced castle, biked around the city, and just enjoyed the colors and sights of the city, I also celebrated my 21st birthday there, and I was so happy to spend it in a gorgeous place with amazing friends eating such good seafood.

Next stop was Barcelona, which was somehow cheaper to fly to than take the train because Spain transportation is weird. I ended up enjoying Barcelona much more than I thought I would. At first it felt like nearly 4 days in Barcelona would be too much but there were places I still didn’t see. After a red eye flight and a stop at the AIrbnb to sleep off the crazy amount of traveling, I headed to downtown to walk around the city, see the Gaudi architecture, and have my mind blown by seeing the Sagrada Familia for the first time. Gaudi’s inspirations were so multifaceted, and a book that I picked up at the Casa Batilo explained they ranged from protozoa to flowers to gothic era cathedrals. Although I wasn’t able to go inside the Sagrada because of sold out Easter week tickets, seeing his mark on the town was a great experience. Our first night we also experienced clubbing in Barcelona, which fully does live up to the hype. Our place of choice, Razzmatazz, had 5 different rooms and a Disney-channel main room that had decorations and backup dancers. Walking back to the Airbnb and the sun coming on the horizon was definitely a sobering experience.

Although I ended up spending a large portion of my Barcelona explorations alone, I sometimes prefer that and having very sporadic plans, sampling many different types of food, and having the space to continue my internal dialogue with the city. One of my stops was at the Picasso museum, which had an incredible collection of his famous work, but also showed the process from his childhood and how his life events affected his art. As love came in and out of his life, as expectations for producing artwork came from his residencies, and as life events changed his perspectives on life, it was openly evident in his work. One of the rooms was entirely focused on his replications of Las Meninas by Velasquez, and deconstructing and reconstructing the piece with his cubism style. Cubism in his work didn't feel abstract, it feels like the most realistic view of what we actually see.

With the group, one of the days we went to Montserrat, a mountain monestary about 2 hours from the main city. While the architecture itself wasn’t incredible compared to what we had seen, the environment was perfect, filled with globular mountains all around and a beautiful hike around. It was clear that it was another place of Gaudis inspiration, with rock formations inspiring his free flowing designs. Me and aarushi went on a solo excursion after the group decided to skip on the hike, going along the edge of the mountain on sometimes suspicious trails. I have a tendency where I always lie about destination times for walks, and its a problem because it’s just subconscious at this point. A 20 minute walk on Google Maps can be cut down to 14 at a good pace so I say 10, so this hike was my time to break this habit and just give aarushi the phone to check the times herself. As the navigator I’m trying to maintain morale, optimize the route while finding the best attractions on the way, and look at my phone as little as possible, so I definitely take some creative liberties in sharing certain facts.

Barcelona closed with the Mercat de Els Encant, the largest market that I’ve ever seen. As you went down the three floors, the offerings got more and more sketch: the top being vintage stores, the second covered with stalls, and the bottom being just tarps laid out with assorted knick-knacks yelling prices at you. I love a good market, especially for getting jewelry and souveneirs, and I’m a self-entitled evil haggler. I use every trick in the book because I believe firmly that they’re trying to scam me at every step, from an instant lowball, to walking away, to asking for a discount for small damages, to getting a smaller item for free on a package deals. After grabbing a couple items, it was back to the airport for my first solo trip in Mallorca!
