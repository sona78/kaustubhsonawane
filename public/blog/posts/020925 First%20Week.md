## Welcome to the blog!

#### 2/9/25

Hi y'all! I'm starting a blog while I study abroad in Budapest, Hungary (surprise!). Everything up until this point had to be well planned out, but the entire journey to get here felt surprisingly chaotic. From choosing a destination that felt foreign but still somehow close, to making sure my life would be properly wrapped up before a hiatus from everything normal, to the final touches on planning a spontaneous but structured 4 months ahead. I'm still trying to figure out the split between the two because spontaneous has often meant unstructured and structured has often meant overthought. With so much open time over the next four months, I'm trying to find some semblance of balance and direction.

Over the last week I tried to push out of my comfort zone and come to Budapest a bit early before classes began. I knew I was comfortable spending time alone, but this was more about learning the place from the ground up and taking the time to really see the city as it is. The first night started off with panicked regret, a well-traveled uber driver ranting about his desire to leave the city as much as possible, a mixed-up closing time leaving me temporarily lost without data, and just the general overwhelming feeling of being away from everyone. Seeing the closest person to me being 1000+ miles in Find My didn't help either. But as quickly as I thought a night would set the tone of the semester, I moved on to just open-eyed exploration. In the week I saw the most gorgeous monuments, explored fresh food with the most bipolar prices at farmers markets, and took the time to slow down. This city moves at a pace so different than the frantic rush that feels typical of a college town.

This feels like the start of freshman year again, but crossed with some strange social simulation. Everyone is so open to meet others and explore, but even when opportunities don't work out, we move on. It's the form of radical acceptance to my life I need to go against my denial of any existing structure. It's going to be a good semester!
