## Slovenia
#### 4/4/25

Personally I didn’t know Slovenia was an actual country until maybe a few years ago. Not once have I sat down and thought about Slovenia but somewhere in our discussions that became the trip of choice to start April with. Study Abroad up until this point has been a collection of new experiences and people, but like always I struggle with building the lasting relationships that I hoped would come from the semester. But friendships are fleeting, and even though being in Budapest didn’t always feel like home, I still pursued new people and conversations and learned from every person I met. Instead, my time abroad was spent between different bases, a group from UT, a few guys from across the US, and a group of international friends. The group from UT had the feelings of a home base, and while I didn’t want to travel with the same group of people my entire time abroad, coming back to see the same people felt so comfortable. And while I went abroad to explore and push myself out of my comfort zone, I missed how comfortable that feeling of a home base truly is. The guy group was a collection of 5 people from Loyola Chicago, the University of Richmond, and UT, and had such an interesting vibe. The best way to describe it was curated, from music tastes to fashion to conversations. Internationality was the value that brought us together, as well as a shared love for hiking for our planned trip to the Dolomites. Finally, we had the collection of international friends that I had made from random Erasmus events and university meetups. It was funny how early and often we talked about politics and how messed up social systems around the world are. One reason I love meeting new people is to understand their base assumptions and test the validity of my own, and with this mix of students from Germany, Turkey, Portugal, and France, asking the most basic level questions revealed more about community, trust, and faith than I expected.

We started our Slovenia trip in Ljubljana (loobiana), the capital city with the population of Plano, TX. While I’m normally a big fan of overnight Flix buses in saving time and money, the travel from Budapest was awful, getting stopped on the Croatian border at 3am for a random passport check and arriving in the city at 5 am far before anything is open. We explored the town and its castle, which had much more of a charm than I expected. The pace of living was slow, much slower than Budapest, and with the Slovenian alps in the background and the sunrise revealing the colors of the houses, it made sense why people chose to savor the day. After the day filled with good food, biking through the park, and a nap outside, we took the bus up to Bled, a popular tourist spot and a town in the alps with a gorgeous lake.

The next 2 days were honestly my most peaceful trip, which also isn’t saying much. On Saturday, we hiked up to the castle, walked around and did a cold plunge in the lake, & rowboated to the middle island. The scenery was beautiful and the temperature was newly warm after 2 months of full winter clothing. We ate sandwiches by the lake and cooked pasta in the evening. I didn’t realize how serious the european aversion to spice is (ironic I know) but I added a bit too much pepper to the pasta which turned out to be too spicy for the germans...

On Sunday, while we were taking the bus on our way to Triglav, a national park comprising 4% of Slovenia, we bumped into a group of other travelers also heading over and from further inquiry were also studying in Budapest. The group, which were exchange students from Morocco and Japan, joined us, going up to the Slap Savic Waterfall, down to lake Bohinj, and taking a nap in the grass surrounded by mountains. Nothing beats an outdoor nap, and as someone who usually wakes up in fear, seeing the iconic slovenian sky (?) wasn’t a bad opener to the rest of the day. I sometimes feel like I open with the same conversations on multiple occasions with international students, trying to understand the most basic tenets of their cultures, but in this setting the curiosity was reciprocated. Being a complete outsider has its benefits of being ready to ask questions rather than assuming with an ego or being expected to know certain things. While answering questions about Hinduism, I realized that I did not have an elevator speech ready, that I’d only been with others who knew or assumed they knew. Not a dig at the world, just a thought for how often I do the same thing about what I don’t know.

Experiencing an entirely new place with entirely new people made this trip quintessentially exchange student life. And for once, I wasn’t rushing to pursue experience after experience, at least not expecting to. With a group that opened up quickly and a traveling style that matched my own, Slovenia was the unique experience I had been hunting for.
