May is finally when Europe gets warm enough to feel bearable, and I honestly didn’t plan much for the weekends initially. The first weekend was spent in Hungary: running on Margaret Island, appreciating the spring weather down the Danube, and a trip to Lake Balaton. With my international friends and the friends that we sporadically made in Slovenia, we made a trip down to Hungary’s largest lake. There were a few funny parts of the place. First, the area was really beautiful and has a walk called the Tagore Promenade, like Rabindranath Tagore who’s one of the most famous writers and poets of India. Apparently he came to Hungary and said that the Balaton water was medicinal and so they named the tree-lined walk next to the lake after him. Second, the lake was really nice to swim in but it’s really shallow. Like you could walk half a mile (kilometer ig) into the lake and it wouldn’t go above your waist. And so when we saw signs remembering a deadly shipwreck, we were quite confused. Unfortunately, my allergies got the best of me that day, but I did enjoy another outdoor nap. The weekend was also labor day & the opening of Spring in Hungary so me and aarushi went to some random markets & fairs around the city.

May was also when Priyanka and Jason were both coming to Budapest, Priyanka for 1 week and Jason for 2. After feeling homesick for quite a while, it was really nice to have a piece of home with me, and with a spare bedroom thankfully unlocked in my apartment, the living situation was just as good. I also love showing people places that I’ve become familiar with for the first time. I appreciate what has become the mundane so much more with a set of fresh eyes. After 2 days in Budapest, seeing things that I hadn’t seen like St. Stephen’s Cathedral, our first weekend trip was to Sardinia, an island off the coast and part of Italy. Again a place that I’ve never thought about once. We landed on the southern coast in the city of Cagliari, staying in a triple room that was honestly quite sketchy. It was a few bedrooms with a shared bathroom, but we noticed that the key for each individual bedroom could unlock anyone elses, so no security or privacy at all. Over the 4 nights we resorted to taking most of our valuables in the car and just barricading the door with a shelf. Oh and the car, because the points around the southern coast were quite far with half of the areas unconnected by public transport, we decided to rent a car which Jason thankfully drove manual. I didn’t realize how much random thought goes into driving manual and I’m thankful I have the luxury without it in the US or at least don’t have the hills that make it scary.

Our first full day in Sardinia we planned to go up the eastern side of the island. I’ve actually never seen water so blue. We stopped sporadically at so many points of interest on the way and got in the water. This was the weekend where I had bought a pair of prescription swim goggles from the Decathlon so I was obsessed with them and the fact that I could finally see underwater. Combined with the clear blue water, it felt like looking into the abyss when I scanned out in front of me. At other points we saw down the coast line, seeing the beaches from a bird’s eye view. On one of the viewpoints, we accidentally scratched our plastic bumper on a rock, and since we had rented from a scammy rental car company that had a reputation of stealing deposits for no reason, we were certainly a bit stressed there. After a gnocchi lunch and gelato stop in the town of Villasimius, the beach exploration day continued at a peninsula, this time on the eastern side of the island. I decided to take some time and dig a giant holle in the ground and spent the next 45 minutes trying to build a castle with a tunnel into the sea, no regrets on that time. The rest of the day we saw the end of the coast and came back home to eat pizza by the kilo.

We had such a great mix of activities on that trip, the second day we explored the city and its markets. Sardinian food also had a mix of pastries and seafood but fell a bit short in its flavor. The city was much older in its style than I expected, so it was a great tour around the area, seeing cathedrals, monuments, and walking through the old town. The evening was the best though, we grabbed a couple aperol spritz bottles from the supermarket which are honestly some of my favorite versions of the drink, and set out on a short hike to the Devil’s “Saddle”. Those viewpoints let us see the entire city and were right on the edge of a cliff. Below were turquoise waters with rough waters creating patterns against the rocks, and with a drink cracked open by a rock, we just enjoyed the moment. I think at this point in the trip I was struggling with frugality. Having traveled for so long and honestly being very content with what I’d seen, the weekly bills of my travels definitely added up. At the same time I wanted to be open to the experiences that my friends from out of town were interested in, so it was a tricky balance that I’m not sure I succeeded in. Regardless, it brought some thoughts about what I was willing to spend on experiences, and in what light I would look back on these memories in. But even throughout the semester I did my best to limit unnecessary spending by cooking my own meals, going to cheap quality places, and planning out select experiences ahead of time instead of sporadic agreement.

The last full day, Priyanka had the idea of grabbing some food for a beach picnic and so we hit up the heaven that is the Conad supermarket and bought burrata, bread, cherry tomatoes, pesto, and balsamic glaze. There was a beach on the west side where we chose to settle down with a sandbar separating the ocean with another body of water and hills on either side. More than that, the water was crystal blue and had waves that you just knew would ignite your inner child. We ate, we got buried in the sand, we played in the waves, life doesn’t get better. In the afternoon, we came to a blue cove known to have a cliff diving spot right on the edge of the ocean. After enjoying the views for a while, we made the ~18 foot jump in, some of us taking much longer than others. To close out the day, we hit the final stop on the western side of the island right on the edge to see the sun on the water. Unfortunately it was cloudy, but we did enjoy a warm aperol spritz with the view.

After returning the car with thankfully no deposit withheld, the last day we had a short time before our flight to eat and visit one place, so me and Jason (Priyanka left early) visited the flamingo preserve. I’ve never actually seen a flamingo in the wild nor see them fly so it was honestly much more beautiful than I expected to see them. Traveling with such close friends made this trip special, and combined with the fact that my expectations about traveling had gotten so much less, I was free to get any amount of joy from our experiences instead of being upset at missed opportunities. It was a wonderful trip in a place that I’d never thought about before, but has some of the most beautiful nature I’ve ever seen.
