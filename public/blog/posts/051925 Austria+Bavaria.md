## Austria+Bavaria

#### 5/19/25

After nearly 4 months in Budapest, it was time to leave, but not before one final trip with just me and Jason to Austria. Specifically Salzburg and the edge of Bavaria. Jason had just one ask from this trip and it was that we hiked, and I’m so glad this was the trip and activity to close off my abroad experience. Thankfully my homesickness was replaced by erratic packing and excitement so I was back in the headspace to make the most of one last trip.

After a 7 hour overnight bus ride, we arrived in Salzburg, ready for a hike called the Eagle’s Nest, which was the meeting grounds for Nazi officials in WWII at the summit of one of the mountains. Salzburg itself had the charms of a small european city and we caught it in a morning with perfect weather. Perfect as in still 40 degrees cold, and the fact that I was going to be back in Texas in less than a week was me putting my body into complete confusion. After another 2 hour train ride through Bavaria, we were ready to hike, but this time, switching to climb up the Jenner mountain, seeing that it was a more panoramic hike. In line with my achievement driven personality, the act of summitting on a hike is always such a rewarding experience, I feel like I get the whole spectrum of emotion from the starting excitement, the middle trudge, the ending sprint, and the relaxed descent. We got exactly that. Unfortunately, the decision to run the day before was not rewarding with a super steep finish. At the top, we had an amazing view of the rest of the mountains and got to experience the quickly changing weather from a total snowstorm in one moment to sunny and peaceful in another. The top had a center that was the top of a cable car route where we had a chance to escape the cold, eating the delicious snacks that we’d lugged up the mountain and watching the clouds go through the area. Nothing beats an outdoor meal like that I miss it so much. I didn’t really realize how tall the mountain was until we started coming down, where at every turn, it felt like we were going to enter back into the village at the base, but nope, it just kept going for miles. That evening, we went to a cozy local restaurant and had some food. Me not eating red meat was quite an issue in Austria & Germany where literally everything was sausage based, but over the days it was just funny how many times we had non-local food. Also our Airbnb for the night was incredible, somehow giving us both a pass for all of the public transportation in the area and also having 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms? Incredible value and it made the nights really feel like a recharge.

The next day was a bit of a break, going to the city of Salzburg and exploring the town there. A break as in not doing things to complete exhaustion, I really haven’t learned. Salzburg had it’s own charm as a cute town with so much history. I enjoyed the fact that none of the buildings really felt out of place and it preserved its historical value in both its architecture and feel. Salzburg is the birthplace of Mozart, and fitting with that, we joined in an organ concert at the Salzburg cathedral. There were 5 organs, 4 that were all designed in different styles, and then one large organ at the back of the church that was that classic organ acoustic that I was craving. Post concert, we walked around the old town, eating at the outdoor food market, and checking out other cathedrals in the area. The house where Mozart was born and grew up was also there, but the bottom floor had been comically converted into a Spar (grocery store). Another time in the afternoon when we went to the palace gardens, we bumped into a group of guys that we’d seen on a prosecco cruise not 3 days before in Budapest. The amount of times that random collisions have happened in terms of an entire continent are a bit concerning. Finally, we ended the day doing a short hike up to a viewpoint of the city and seeing the sunset that had broken up the clouds from before.

I think that me and Jason travel really well together, and just that made the trip so special. We both are very willing to do new things and match the other person’s energy in a situaition where one of us are excited. We both like to have some sort of the plan to structure the days ahead, even if I’m a bit more type A about it. Even when I’m a bit more irrational or particular about something, he balances me out and accepts the situation which although is a trait I need to work on, still helps. Jason put it very well that traveling with someone else is the best way to truly understand them. He said that all the decisions that someone makes are a reflection of their personality rather than other associated traits showing interests, decision-making approach, and base fundamentals that shine through. I think that traveling is such an interesting framework because there’s not really a “right” way to do it. Obviously certain decisions are going to play out better than others, but that too is a product of your foresight abilities. Just going down this rabbit hole, normally when you’re engaged in a task, there’s some sense of a success metric you’re interacting with where decisions then become a function of your personality crossed with the task-specific knowledge, trying to minimize this error function and do the best in that category. While your values stay the same/change very slowly, theres a more actively engaged feedback loop that allows you to adjust your task specific knowledge quickly. I think traveling is quite similar in the function, but people are more aware that the error metric isn’t a standardized thing. What do we correct on, would it be some quantification of fun? or ability to execute on the plan? It might be part of the reason traveling refreshes the mind. Breaking out of that optimization loop just for a second (in this case a semester) or at least creating your own metrics becomes an invaluable exercise that builds that ability in traditional tasks as well. For me, it has been thinking more clearly about my career and life in a more fluid perspective, trying to unlearn the purely achievement driven mindset that has been trained into me for so long.

On our final day in Austria, we went to the incredible village of Hallstatt. When me and Aarushi were first getting excited about Europe study abroad before coming, Hallstatt was one of the places that we were amazed by. And how could you not be, a picturesque village in the heart of the alps, what’s there not to love. After a 3 hour journey there from Salzburg, we arrived in the main city. It was such a quaint little town but was incredibly overrun by tourists packing the narrow streets. Regardless, we walked through the city and took in the views, including the famous view of the city that I’d only seen in pictures. We started to notice a pattern in the tourist groups being all asian, which made sense normally, but when we visited an information desk and Jason spoke in Mandarin to the employee, I was deeply confused. Turns out, China loved hallstatt so much that they built an exact replica of the city called Hallstatt, China. One difference, they don’t have the alps so it’s just a small village for visitors in China.

After a couple hours in the town, we looked for our potential hike of the day. After going up a route that we had initially planned, we saw that it was blocked off until September, so to save the day, we went up the cable car to the upper area of the mountain to take in the view of the valley. The top had a bit of a skywalk for a photo op, which was gorgeous, but the view didn’t feel earned, it just felt like a packaged experience, which neither I nor Jason cared very much for in that moment. So we decided to earn that view. We started hiking up quite an incline on the side, to an area that was unmarked but had a route labeled in AllTrails. And thank god we did, the scenery only got better from there, with perfect clear weather and snow covered mountains all around us. Unfortunately, we were once again rushing to make it down to make the last cable car. We started on a supposed one hour ascent in which we hit a 20 minutes left sign an hour later after making some wrong turns, so at some point we began racing the clock. Jason unfortunately tapped out near the end, so I sprinted down that trail to hopefuly catch the view at the end. And it was so worth it, the top was another summit with clear views of the valley down below really showing us how high we had made it. Even after we made it down and were waiting for the bus, we saw a rainbow on the lake in front of us. The rainbow was so clear and localized that you could see exactly where it rose out of the water in front of us. That was the perfect close to my study abroad. Accomplishment, peace, and friends that I care about.

This semester wasn’t perfect, but I’d say I made the most of the time. I saw more than I’ve ever seen, I made friends I could have never met, and I tried approaching each day as a little experiment to learn about myself. I have more confidence in my abilities to start over in a completely new place and to consider many different factors when planning for the future. And when every decision I made in those situations was truly out of my own accord, I observed myself making mistakes to learn from and iterate on very quickly. Even though I’m not a great writer, I’ve also loved writing this blog, and love the ability to continue some of these more formed thoughts into in-person conversations, so I will be transitioning over to Substack [here](https://substack.com/@sonaom78) to share some of my ideas moving forward.
