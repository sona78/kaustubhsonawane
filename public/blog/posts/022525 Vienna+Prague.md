## Prague + Vienna
#### 2/25/25

I love traveling. I think I had an idea of how much I enjoyed the newness of exploration, but I didn't realize how much the minute things of seeing a new city bring joy. After the week alone and the week of orientation, I, along with a few friends from UT, decided to go to Vienna as our first weekend exploration. Even though it was only a 3 hour bus ride away, it felt like relearning from the ground up. From the language change to German to the architecture style that feels like a classical-era piece come to life, just walking around the city through the old and new was my favorite part.

While the elegance and the artistry of the city was undeniable, I didn't enjoy it as much as Budapest. The way that I approach growth in my own life revolves around honesty. I think trying to work on a particular part of my personality means accepting that it exists, that I am constantly an imperfect being. My critique on Vienna and my critique on Classical-age music overall is that it displays a facade of perfection onto an imperfect city. While the city's palaces showed off ornate gold leaf chandeliers and frescoes, our group was getting dirty looks in the street and getting passport-checked by the undercover police. Maybe I'm being petty about all of the ticket-gated museums (not a cheap city :o) and attractions that seemed like just a view into a bloated upper class. Vienna might finally be the only city that's honest about its intentions to extract value from the flocks of tourists. The environment plastered perfection onto an increasingly imperfect reality, at least did at some point. The reality was quite gorgeous though, palaces and cathedrals and museums and just a constant wow factor.

With such back-to-back travel, my new mission at home has just been to branch out. Sometimes I regret staying closer to comfort in the first few weeks of the study abroad experience, but I've been the same person throughout in trying to connect with different people and understand who matches my energy. Budapest has a great combination of exchange students from across Europe and feels accepting of cultural diversity, so it's been such a cool time getting to understand the base level assumptions that each person carries. Also while I'm here I'm especially tuned into what I say. I have to check myself for much of the idiomatic expressions in English that I take for granted (Ex: "run with it") and my excessive use of the word "y'all". From politics to university culture to home environments, even surface level conversations are exciting. I think reestablishing a sense of "home" here has been a priority, in people, places, and routines, but I'm starting to understand that it's not a requirement. I've lived much of life in the closeness of one group to the next, I finally have the opportunity to try something else. And at the end of the trip, I'll go back to everything and everyone that I know I love.

My most recent trip was to Prague this last weekend. I absolutely adored it. Neha and some friends flew in from Edinburgh and she joined us on the trip so it was surreal having all of us exploring a foreign country for the first time. Prague is a very old city with medieval and gothic architecture everywhere. The city felt stable and regal, a humble beauty to it. There was beautiful viewpoints to walk up to, cathedrals and castles everywhere, and such good food places. My favorite part of this trip was walking up to the top of petrin hill and just spending 20 minutes on a bench and admiring the beauty of the view and weather. Other than an unforeseen sickness and sleepless overnight bus, the experience was a 10/10. I had the best time with the group I was with, but I'm ready to see different styles of traveling and have that influx of ideas. It's too easy for me to fall back to comfort, but I know if I stay on this path of openness and inclusiveness, it's going to work out!
