## Switzerland
#### 3/31/25

Throughout my travels so far, I’d had the chance to explore cities and immerse myself in so many cultures back to back. Half the joy in traveling was facing the language barrier and having to build an understanding of the public transport network. But having my first nature trip in Switzerland showed me exactly why I’d grown up traveling the way that I did. As a family, we’ve exclusively been to state and national parks, which was definitely a point of argument for a younger me that wanted to see what cities offered. In my mind, nature became redundant after a point past the basic biomes, and not having gone to any country past India and the US felt like I was missing out on the rest of the world. Over the years, people more than experiences or achievements have become the focus of my life with an infinite amount of variation more in a person than the world, but after a few weeks of seeing this same variety in each new european country, nature felt like a release. Sometimes traveling in a city feels like it’s an experience designed to extract value from you, from curated viewpoints that all the tourists flock to or the endless rows of shitty restaurants with waiters always in the same outfit calling out to you. Switzerland, while just as expensive, was different.

We started our trip in Basel, a smaller city right at the border between France, Germany, and Switzerland, flying in and spending the morning walking around. Basel was so funny in that as soon as you stepped over the border from the airport in France just 10 minutes away into Switzerland everything went from French to German. Not much to do in the city but once the rest of our group joined us on the next flight, we went directly to Grindelwald where we were staying.

Grindelwald was this beautiful village in the valley of these gigantic mountains that we got a great view of from our place. Our first day we had gorgeous weather and I built up an expectation of what the day could be, and when random delays and incredibly early closing times didn’t line up with our plans, I was definitely disappointed. In retrospect, everything worked out just the way that it had to, missing one attraction on Friday led to an ever more perfect day on Sunday. The area that we were in was the Jungfrau region and had 3 main hubs of Grindelwald, Interlaken, and Lauterbrunnen with smaller villages on the sides of the mountains accessible only by cable car or a railway. The rest of Friday we hiked the North Face trail in Murren, but having to turn around a bit earlier so that we wouldn’t get caught past sunset. The trail started off beautiful because of the valley views but quickly became surreal entering into an entirely alpine world with snow 2 feet deep covering the trails. At one point my vision started going black as the sun was setting and it seemed like a better idea to turn back rather then getting caught in the pitch black snow with nothing around us.

Saturday was also a great day filled with hiking at Harder Klum in Interlaken and another trail in Wengen (other mountain village). The days felt more significant surrounded by nature, having a clear start and end and being filled with so much change. Coming down the mountain on the Wengen trail was such a peaceful time as the clouds lowered once again, the sun set and the colors of the surrounding greenery changed. On the mountains, nature felt like a perfect system, but for once I didn’t feel like an intruder, just a silent observer.

Sunday was one of the best days of my life, after waking up planning on going up to Grindelwald first, a cliff walk and cable car excursion, we were stopped by the clouds. Trying to make the most of the rideup, we decided to wait it out until the sun got a bit brighter and grabbed breakfast at the grocery store. What was supposed to be a quick check at the train station for getting tickets turned into us getting a pass for all of the mountains in the area for a fraction of the cost. We spent the day hiking in the total alpine regions at the top of the mountains, tobogganing down thousands of feet, and seeing the prettiest places I’d ever seen, all while the sun was out and the sky was clear. One of the features was Mannlichen, when the fog cleared at the top and we could see 5 peaks lit up in the sun in the distance at such staggering scales.

I’m working on having longer curves in this emotional rollercoaster, and part of maturing is that I’m realizing the lows always have an up, not that in this case any part of it was a low, it’s Switzerland. But the “chance” occurences are what made this trip truly special, far beyond any plan I could have made.
