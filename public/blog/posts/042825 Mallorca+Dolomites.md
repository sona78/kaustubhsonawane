## Mallorca + Dolomites

#### 4/28/25

There’s definitely a fine line between sponteneity and stupidity and in retrospect some of the things I did when solo traveling might have been a little suspicious but that’s part of the fun. Honestly solo traveling sounds super cool in retrospect as a story. Like being in a foreign place and getting to understand it entirely on my own was incredible, but in the moment while I did appreciate that it was a unique experience and that I am comfortable alone, it’s definitely not that exceptional. I guess since freshman year of college I’ve been pulling experiments to test that I am truly comfortable alone. At the start, it might have been me coping with the fact that I hadn’t met the friends that clicked yet, but even once I did, it was things like spending a day biking, shopping, eating alone. Partially because I wanted to do all of these things with full agency but partly for reminding myself that I could. Even though college life has been incredible, it is still life and FOMO was so strong, not of other people but this idealized version of college that I for no reason expected. So when I’m alone by choice for these stints, it stripped away expectations for a few hours or a day, or in the case of Mallorca, 4, that if I could be truly happy alone then people in my life would be a choice and not a necessity, which I think just makes those relationships feel more important.

I was in Mallorca for 4 nights staying at a hostel for the first time. Great experience, we had little pod rooms with electronic lockers instead of the typical bunk bed setup, and for the sake of the 18 person room that a friend called “a refugee camp”, my snoring was restricted to my pod. As soon as I landed, I realized I truly had not planned anything out, which is so different than my usual style. Traveling for so long made it impossible to plan the way I usually plan, which might be a bit overboard but thinking through activities and good food spots. I hate having to make those decisions super on the fly, but in an environment where only I could take the hit if a choice failed, it truly didn’t matter. So I did the natural thing someone one do when traveling solo and camped out in the lobby scouting for a friend. Honestly it worked out so well, the guy I was sitting next to happened to be a solo traveler with no plans in mind for the rest of the day. A consultant at a tech company, we talked about career, directionless ambition, and the tate-ification of young men. After grabbing a tapas dinner at this delicious spot called Bar España, where I didn’t realize how much unique mallorcan food existed, we headed our separate ways.

I had a perfect blend of people and alone time the next 3 days. I arrived on a Saturday so on Sunday, I woke up with a plan to see easter mass and get inside the Palma Cathedral. The inside was a combination of old architecture with a Gaudi restoration, a domain where his style thrives. But once I realized mass was 2 hours and entirely in latin or spanish, I decided to skip out after a quick peek, and instead took an excursion to several gorgeous villages on the northwestern side of the island called Valldemossa, Deia, and Soller. Deia had the architectural style of old tuscan vilages but was on the side of a beautiful green mountain. While the town was small, I loved walking around, seeing the view of the ocean. Everywhere I went, there were trees of lemon, orange, and these small sour/sweet fruits called nisperos. Nispero trees were literally everywhere and every chance I got, I grabbed a handful of the fruit and ran from private property. Soller was right next to the beach and a lot more commercialized. The winding motion of the bus combined with the vibrations of the road had me falling asleep but afraid to miss my stop, so the first thing I did in Soller was walk to the beach, lay out my blanket, and take a long nap listening to the waves. After some time seeing the cliffs, I headed back to the town and watched the sunset on the mountains behind the area, desperately trying to grab a Soller orange off the trees. In the evening, the hostel group chat was buzzing with people trying to drive to the other side of the island mostly inaccessible by public transportation, and so I decided to join with a random group and make the most of the hostel experience.

In the morning, our group met again after a short planning session the night before. Made up of a doctor from Germany, an Oxford MBA student, and a student from USC, it was quite a combination. The dynamic is quite interesting because none of us had any tie to each other, so compromises and group choices stem entirely from either sticking to social norms or how each person tends to behave. After a bit of delay shuttling to the airport and back trying to find the rental car center, We set off and drove an hour to the southeastern side of the island. The south side of Mallorca is entirely lined with these beautiful beaches and inlets, and I decided to skip the local caves experience to go to the beach instead, swimming in one of these turquoise water coves. As a group, we spent the rest of the day hopping between different beaches down the line, the prettiest of which was a 30 minute walk towards the beach but was stunning. Somehow there were 2 beaches that were perpendicular to each other in this inlet area, and we had the unique experience of swimming from one beach to another through the crystal clear water. We ended the night with the first of many awkward goodbyes, closing the day filled with pretty places, good music, and peace.

After an excursion day, I decided to take the next day to myself around Palma, the largest city where I was staying. Palma had a collection of amazing food markets that I wanted to try some local specialties. Since the island was just coming off of easter festivities, the options were endless. The best eats of the day were the Soller oranges that genuinely tasted like candy, Robiols which are a soft shortbread pocket filled with jam (easter specialty), Ensaimadas which were fried and filled with sweet pumpkin jam, and an octopus sandwich. In the afternoon, I headed over to the Bellver castle, the only round castle I’d ever seen. Built like a fortress, the place had such interesting history about mallorca and great views over Palma. Closing up the evening on the beach, I came back and prepared for the next leg of the trip in the Italian dolomites.

The time alone was certainly appreciated, but after 4 days of navigating complete unfamiliarity and a week of half of traveling, I was ready for some semblance of settling down. After a short flight to Venice, I spent the day with Josiah exploring the city. After only a short stint in the evening trying food all over Venice in March, returning to an already familiar place was a funny experience. I’m excited in the future for when I return to some of these cities and live them truly without any expectations of going to any of their spots. And I like Venice as a concept, but combined with the concrete (rock?) jungle and overtourism, also the 10 dollar fee just to enter the place, not my favorite place. After a short public gondola ride, sight seeing around St. Mark’s Square, and a super late lunch, we sprinted to the bus up to the South Tyrol region.

So one thing about the Dolomites public transportation is that they operate on a peak and non-peak schedule. There’s 2 peaks, one for skiing and one for hiking. Because of the postponement of our trip by a few days, we’d just missed one of the peaks by 3 days so public transportation was essentially missing in the city that we were staying. Not a fun realization and period of regret before the trip began, but in retrospect, it didn’t make an ounce of difference for how incredible that trip was. Also one of the transportation networks that was incredibly affordable was open just with less intermediate timings (thank you Suedtirolmobil). Our first stop was in Bolzano, probably the largest city in the area. While our initial plan was to hike Seceda, one of the classic dolomites spots with giant green fields and rock formations, the avalanche risk of that day made it impossible, and so we spent the morning going up via cable car to the village areas on the surrounding mountains. To make sure we got to the place that we were staying (Cortina), we took an earlier connection up to Toblach/Dobbiaco. The South Tyrol region of Italy basically just feels like a part of Germany being right below Austria, and has all of their city names in both German and Italian. Having luggage, we were worried about not finding storage, and after not finding any in the city, one of the guys, Jaydeep, managed to Google translate his way into convincing a bar owner to hold our bags for the afternoon. Thankfully, we were able to go on our hike for the day, which was a loop around the nearby lake, nestled at the base of the nearby mountains. The area was super pretty but the best find was just a bit off the trail. We saw a large structure that looked like it had been destroyed in an avalanche with warped metal exteriors and moss growing, but on further inspection, only the outside shell was damaged while the inside gates remained intact. Eventually we found a door that led inside to pitch black. After a quick search on google we found that it was a WWII era bunker for the italians, and exploring it revealed it had a shooting area, a medical wing, and entire downstairs underground. As soon as you stepped in the bunker, instantly no service, so exploring definitely brought some concerning thoughts.

Reconnecting with our overall group of 5 in Cortina was awesome. After an unfortunate exit at the wrong stop 45 minutes away from our Airbnb on the last bus into the city, we began our trek. The thing about consistently lying about arrival times, I did it again, but only to drop morale when we were honestly quite close near the end! Luckily, the guys coming in from France that day had gone grocery shopping and filled the fridge with everything we needed for avoiding the overpriced town restaurants like a plague, trekking it up an insane incline hill for a walkway. Even though getting around was a logistical nightmare that was a “make the bus” or stay stranded in the mountains situation, I was never stressed about the situation. On our first full day, we went to the town to try and figure out transportation logistics, and after getting told everything was closed because of the recent snowstorms, we relied on a paper map to plan our excursions. After getting a view of the town from a view point a quick 30 minute hike up, we headed down to catch the bus to our big hike of the day, Tre Cime, which were 3 peaks visible between the valley of other mountains. We honestly didn’t even hike to a specific viewpoint, everywhere was quite pretty but we were just enjoying the company and the fact that we were in the dolomites. Eating sandwiches on the rocks next to the river, bearing the rain, and seeing the scenery get more alpine, but still such a withdrawal from the world. The dolomites are a mountain range that feel untamed. Switzerland was gorgeous but quite commercialized at this point, but these mountains made you put in the work to see them. My mountain adventures of the semester sometimes put me in stressful situations, but honestly stress is a fight or flight response being activated for absolutely nothing in my normal life, so I’d much rather be stressed about getting stranded in the alps than about a comparatively minute problem at home. A form of adrenaline meditation that I need more of in my life.

Our Airbnb complemented our days so well, after a day of intense hiking and another intense walk to get back home, it was a nice cozy chalet with a balcony overlooking the town. We’d cook, eat, drink, and chat as the sun set behind the jagged mountains taking up the horizon. And sunsets were a different experience there, with a purple hue in the sky inviting the night filled with snowstorms on the mountains.

The second day, we found a trail a 30 minute bus ride from the city, where at the end there was a massive canyon that looked pretty much uncrossable. At this point the sun had miraculously come out for the afternoon and so the entire route was green fields and rivers at the base of other snow capped peaks. When we got to the canyon, after another sandwich lunch, we looked to the side and saw the steepest drop trail crisscrossing down the slope that had the same markings as the trail below. From the bottom inside this 200 foot canyon, we stood right next to a pouring waterfall with so much force to the falling water. The trail beyond looked unstable and from there a via ferrata route started, which with its 50+ foot drop onto the rocks and our complete lack of gear seemed like a wrong decision.

After we came back to the initial trailhead, Jaydeep and I had the masochistic idea of trying to do a second trail, crunching the estimated time of 2.5 hours into 1.5 to catch our bus. Our initial plan was to hike up to the first viewpoint and come back down, but the trail looked insane, so we decided to push through the entire thing. That was probably the hike that I’ve pushed myself the most on, and so far for me I’ve really only encountered reaching my cardio limit in running, which I guess was basically what we were doing there. The top had one of the best views of the area, a former Italian military bunker inside the mountain that we could hear the echos of below, and on every side a view of the surrounding mountains and the town of Cortina in the distance. Even though we came back home utterly exhausted, I’m happy that I squeezed every drop out of that day. I’ve been noticing in my travels, I hate the feeling of a subpar experience, or the regret of a missed experience all together. It’s a bit of a self inflicted tendency. I feel the pain of regret strongly compared to anything in the moment and I tend to have rose tinted glasses looking backwards. But as a result of that, I have a tendency to rush to new experiences instead of savoring each moment, which is a direction I need to grow. Either accepting that the world is there and I can always come back for more or just a broader shift in my mindset about where fulfillment really comes from.

On our last day, after 2 of our group members left earlier in the morning, Jaydeep and I hiked around close to our airbnb, just taking a route up to right next to one of the mountains. That hike was so peaceful, and we could see the clouds moving so quickly, dropping rain at one moment and then clear the next. We found a rock to climb up on that had a makeshift ladder made of tree branches where we sat and again ate sandwiches. Deli meat is a hidden gem for travel, average meals in beautiful places make them taste so good. And after packing up the place, it was the end of our spring break: 2 countries and 6 cities later. Well at least before a nearly 12 hour bus ride to get back home. Traveling for so long made me even more homesick than I was before, and after not seeing my family for at the time 3 months, I was all traveled out and ready for comfort. At the very least, Budapest felt like the intermediary before home, and looking back at it in retrospect, I’m so lucky to have learned a completely foreign city in that much detail.
